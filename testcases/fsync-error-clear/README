There are a few different but related tests here.

All the tests share a common filesystem setup with a loopback volume wrapped by
a device-mapper device which puts an error hole in the middle of the FS. Writes
to and reads from the hole always EIO.

standalone/ tests with a simple program designed to run write() then fsync() in
a loop until it hits an error, then examine the error behavour. This is the
default target of "make".
