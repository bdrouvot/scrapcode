This test runs on a JBoss AS 7 server. It demonstrates that when using
EclipseLink on AS7, the static metamodel is not populated until:

- An EntityManager is injected (via CDI's @Inject or via @PersistenceContext) and then accessed; or
- An EntityManagerFactory is injected then one of these methods is called:
  * getCriteriaBuilder()
  * createEntityManager()
  * getMetamodel()

The EntityManagerFactory methods getPersistenceUnitUtil(), getProperties() and
isOpen() do NOT trigger population of the static metamodel. Similarly, just injecting
an EntityManager doesn't seem to either, it needs to be acceessed in some way.

These tests demonstrate this behavour. If all tests pass, the behaviour is as
described above. If any tests fail, the behaviour varied from the expected
fault. If you'd prefer the tests asserted the correct behaviour not the
expected behaviour, set assertExpectedButIncorrect in TestBase to false.

These tests also show that AS7+Hibernate behaves correctly.


== RUNNING THE TESTS AGAINST ECLIPSELINK ==

Run the tests by deploying a copy of the EclipseLink module to AS7:

   mvn depdendency:resolve
   cp ~/.m2/repository/org/eclipse/persistence/eclipselink/2.4.0/eclipselink-2.4.0.jar\
      jboss7modules/org/eclipse/persistence/main/eclipselink-2.4.0.jar
   cp -r jboss7modules/* $JBOSS_HOME/modules/

... then starting the server with bin/standalone.sh and running:

  mvn -Djboss.as.version=YOUR_JBOSS_VERSION clean test

The default target version is the latest AS7 7.2.0-ALPHA1-SNAPSHOT.


== RUNNING THE TESTS AGAINST ECLIPSELINK ==

For comparison, run the test against Hibernate.

Edit src/main/java/META-INF/persistence.xml and change the persistence
provider as per the comments. Then re-run with the same command line.

You'll see that all the tests are "in error" because the static metamodel
was unexpectedly non-null (ie spec-correct) before each test.

If you set assertExpectedButIncorrect in TestBase to false, all tests will pass,
as they should.

We can thus see that AS7 + Hibernate behave correctly.



== What's wrong with the demonstrated behaviour of AS7+EclipseLink ==

The static metamodel should be populated when the EntityManagerFactory is created,
as per JSR 317 (JPA 2.0):

    When the entity manager factory for a persistence unit is created, it is the
    responsibility of the persistence provider to initialize the state of the
    metamodel classes of the persistence unit. Any generated metamodel classes must
    be accessible on the classpath.

... so the static metamodel should be populated (non-null) whenever we have, or
have had, an EntityManager or EntityManagerFactory reference.
