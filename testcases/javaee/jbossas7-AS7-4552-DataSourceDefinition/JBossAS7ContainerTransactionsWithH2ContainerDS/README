This test demonstrates that container managed transactions work correctly with
the H2 database using a datasource managed directly by JBoss AS 7. The
ExampleDS is used, but a new datasource created via jboss-cli.sh works too.
  
RUNNING THE TEST
----------------

Then run the test:

  mvn clean install
  $YOUR_PREFERRED_BROWSER http://localhost:8080/AS7TxTest-1.0-SNAPSHOT/

What should happen, as per the source code, is the display of a one-liner
web page that says the database successfully performed an operation that can
only be done within a transaction.

That's exactly what happens.

CLEANUP
-------

To undeploy the test, run:

  mvn jboss-as:undeploy
