This is a toy extension I wrote while playing with uuid/binary conversion
in PostgreSQL. It was prompted by this Stack Overflow post:

    http://stackoverflow.com/q/24883127/398670

To compile and install, just make sure pg_config is on your PATH and run:

    make
    sudo make install

If you encounter any errors, make sure you have the PostgreSQL development
headers and tools, not just the runtime. On Linux you may need to install a
-dev or -devel package.

There are no pre-compiled Windows binaries of this extension and I haven't
tested compiling it on Windows - or in fact anything except my Fedora 17 x64
box running PostgreSQL 9.1. Needless to say, it's hardly production quality.



To use the random_bytea extension connect to the database of your choice and
run:

    CREATE EXTENSION uuid_bytea;

You can now convert bytea to uuid:

	SELECT bytea_to_uuid(BYTEA '\x0FCC6350118D11E4A5597DE5338EB025');

or vice versa:

    SELECT uuid_to_bytea(UUID '0fcc6350-118d-11e4-a559-7de5338eb025');

Explicit casts between bytea and uuid are also provided.
